## ü§ñ optional extra credit opportunities

If you want to improve your grade (or you want a chance for a little more reflection or challenge) - you can take the time to do 1 or more of the following extra credit opportunities. 

(Remember - these are **optional!** I would love for you to do them if you are interested or want the grade boost, but they are by no means required.)

### 1 - üé® Museum
Go to the Museum of Modern Art or the Whitney Museum of American Art (CUNY students go free with student ID! [MoMa](https://www.moma.org/teaching/education-partnerships/moma-cuny-partnerships), [Whitney - see "University Students" on this page](https://whitney.org/visit/free-admission). If you go to MoMa: make sure to check out Rafa√´l Rozendaal's large scale code work in the lobby, the Jack Whitten "The Messenger" exhibit on Floor 6, and various video art on Floor 2. If you go to the Whitney: make sure to check out the "Shifting Landscapes" exhibit on Floor 6, and the "Marina Zurkow: Parting Worlds" exhibit outdoors on Floor 5. You are also encouraged to explore the museums generally - there are _so_ many striking (and sometimes famous) works on display. Write a reflection (at least 750 words) about what you see, and connect these art exhibits to your own experience as a student of technology and someone making technology. What might you want to make, and why? How do these art pieces inspire, challenge, or make you think differently about technology's role in society? How does learning C++ today give you ideas about what technology you want to make in the future? Include 1 photo that you take (you can use your phone) of a piece that you found particularly interesting in the museum.

### 2 - üëæ Reflection: ChatGPT
Choose 1 problem from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), any problem after Problem #9. Your goal: try to get [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to write a C++ program that provides the answer correctly. Write about your experience using the bot for this purpose - what prompts did you need to use, what questions did you need to ask? What was the give-and-take between you the chatbot? What were your surprises, successes, frustrations? What do you think about ChatGPT as a tool for writing code, or for learning code? What are your thoughts about generative AI as a student and a programmer moving forward? Show both your code, some of the bot's code, and your original written reflections here, at least 750 words. I am more interested in your own reflection on this _process_ than the final "product" of ChatGPT's code!

### üê† how does this work? 

- If you complete an extra credit assignment, it can boost your grade half a "step" - going from B to B+, C+ to B-, B+ to A-, for example.
- If your average in the class < 70% (but above 50%) and you complete 1 extra assignment, **you can receive a passing final grade in the class.**
- You may do more than 1 extra credit assignment, but the maximum it will boost your grade is a half "step." So: doing 2 extra credit pieces does not mean a C will turn into a B. You may do more than 1 because you are interested, or to make sure that you are turning in solid work on at least 1!
- These assignments will still be graded - they need to be **original, thoughtful work** that you have put time and care into, in order to receive full points.
- A quick note on A+: A+ is a rare grade in this class, not given to everyone with 97+%. If you have an A, doing an extra credit assignment does not guarantee an A+. (But I welcome you taking on the opportunity for a challenge!)
- [Academic honesty](https://github.com/mab253/cpp_fall24/#academic-honesty-and-integrity), as always, applies. Do not plagiarize! And that includes using Gen. AI to write either of these assignments - they are supposed to be _your_ reflections.

**These assignments are due to me via e-mail by Thusday, May 22nd, by 11:59pm.** I cannot accept late work for extra credit assignments. Good luck and have fun!
