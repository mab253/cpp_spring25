# ðŸŽ¥ week 1: input/output, hello world

For this week's video, you'll watch some examples of live coding C++ programs from scratch.

To start, here are 2 examples of a program that prints "hello world!", a programmer's classic first program when learning any language (this will very much help you for the lab assignment this week):
- "[A First C++ Program: Hello World!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXpPo3PTsRo)" (Heidi Kolen) 
- "[C++ Hello World Short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CyZsSlTyv5Y)" (TechPlus Academy)
  
Here are also 2 line-by-line helpful examples of getting user input using `cin >>` and printing with `cout <<`:
- "[Using cin and cout](https://youtu.be/AKvdqn7zRiY?si=zBnuMDV4jwSobX7-)" (Heidi Kolen)
- "[How to accept user input in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imiIhu9u670)" (Bro Code)

What are some differences that you notice among these programs? What are some differences between these examples and code snippets from the zyBooks this week? All of these are valid C++ programs! **Write any comments/questions in the #code-questions channel in our Discord.**
