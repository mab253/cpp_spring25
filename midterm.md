Your team's task is to write 1 C++ program that performs different cryptographic tasks for Alice and Bob:

### 1. 📊 Frequency Analysis + Decryption

Your team will be given an encrypted text in the `midterm` folder of the Github. Your task is to write code that helps decrypt the text. The text has been encrypted by Alice using a **Vigenère cipher**. The letters have been placed into groups of 5 so that the word breaks are disguised. The **key** is one of the words listed in a file called `keys.txt` in the Github. This file is also uploaded in the zyBooks lab.

Remember, research and asking questions is encouraged here! You might want to start with this video about [**polyalphabetic ciphers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFJD7oCmDE&list=PLSQl0a2vh4HA50QhFIirlEZRXG4yjcoGM&index=7). (highly recommended)

Your program should output a **frequency analysis** showing the counts of every letter of the given encrypted text. Then the program needs to output the correct original (decrypted) plaintext, and the correct key that you found.

**BONUS:** can you write your program so that it suggests to your user what the correct key should be?

### 2. 🔒 Encryption

Your program should take an input text from your user, and then encrypt that text **with an encryption algorithm of your own design.** The steps of your encryption need to be reversible; for example, if Alice encrypts the message and Bob knows the key, Bob should be able to decrypt it.

Your program should output the encrypted text and the key. Other requirements:
- your encryption should make use of a pseudorandom number generator **of your own design** - not `rand()`
- you might start by watching this video about the [**one-time pad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlIG3TvQCBQ&list=PLSQl0a2vh4HA50QhFIirlEZRXG4yjcoGM&index=9). How can you make use of this method?
- your method can have multiple layers and operations - is there a substitution step? Is there another shift performed after? Creativity will be rewarded!
- the goal here is _not_ to pull in someone else's pre-existing algorithm, but to create your own with your team, using math that you know. Remember, encryption is just scrambling data with math.

### Program Design

Your program should be in 1 `cpp` file. Your user should be able to choose which task (Part 1 analysis/decryption, or Part 2 encryption) that they want to perform, like a menu of options.

Beyond these requirements listed, the implementation is up to you!

### Groundrules

- Your team can delegate the work however you choose - but every team member should be able to explain the code by the end of the week, and everyone needs to submit a full program, so you need to combine and share your work.
- You may need research for this project - but the goal here is to use the **skills you have learned in this class** already. If you are using code that you do not understand or seeking out new libraries in order to build this program, your team should re-think the approach!
- You may use any source available, _as long as you cite_. This includes the Internet, zyBooks and other books, _light use_ of AI tools, other people in the class, etc. Please use the [course guidelines](https://github.com/mab253/cpp_spring25/blob/main/ai-citations.md) for how to do this with comments in your code.
- You will not lose points for researching and using other sources with citation. You **will lose points** for seeking out code generated by others (people or bots) as a _significant portion of your solution_. I may ask your team to explain any line of your code. You may also lose points for using methods beyond the scope of this class without citation and an explanation of your reasoning.

### Evaluation

Your team's program will be evaluated on:
- functionality: does your program run smoothly without error? does it make sense for the user to run?
- completeness: does your program perform all the tasks?
- creativity: does your methodology show original work?
- style: can we read your code?! is your spacing and indentation legible? are you using loops and vectors where you can avoid repetition? etc.

Every project will be graded as a whole, and then based on a final submission form where you discuss your week and the division of labor, every individual will get a midterm grade as well.

### Platforms & Submission

You may want to use [replit.com](https://replit.com), [glot.io](https://glot.io/new/cpp), or your own text editor to develop and code together. Your final submission should be in zyBooks, section 16.41. You can always code in the zyBooks lab as well to develop your work.

- The zyBooks lab should accept your code no matter what - for this project, there is no feedback from unit or output tests! You can submit as many times as you need before the deadline.

- **Each team member** needs to submit code via zyBooks 16.41, even if your team's code is exactly the same.

👽 Good luck!
